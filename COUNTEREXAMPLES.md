# Counterexample Log

This file records all known failed or partial attempts
to refute XYSTEM / LSR.

## Attempt classes

### 1. Abelian Cayley graphs
- Z_n^d: links collapse but spectral gap persists.
Not a counterexample.

### 2. Nilpotent groups
- Heisenberg quotients: no explosion in short-relator homology.

### 3. Random lifts
- High probability local asymmetry supports XYSTEM.

### 4. Expanders with large girth
- No failure of LSR observed.

### 5. Wreath products
- No bounded-degree vertex-transitive examples violate LSR.

## Status
No genuine counterexample currently known.
