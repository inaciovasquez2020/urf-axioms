# Open Challenge: The XYSTEM Axiom

Status: Open Problem (Conditional)

## Problem
Prove or refute the following statement:

For every Δ ≥ 1 there exist constants R(Δ), C(Δ) > 0 such that for every
finite vertex-transitive graph G with deg(G) ≤ Δ,

tr((Δ¹_{X_R(G)})†) ≤ C(Δ).

Equivalently:
∃ R, ε > 0 such that for all v,
λ₁(Lk_R(v)) ≥ ε.

## Context
This problem is equivalent to:
- Local Spectral Rigidity
- Garland transfer over F₂
- Uniform linear filling
- Hypergraph rank rigidity
- Oblivion Atom (FOᵏ locality collapse)

## Status
No proof or counterexample known.
See axioms/XYSTEM.tex for formal definition.
