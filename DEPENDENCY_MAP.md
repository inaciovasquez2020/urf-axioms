# Dependency Map (Conditional Layer)

This file records all results in the URF program that depend on XYSTEM.

## Core dependency
XYSTEM

## Direct consequences (Conditional)
- Local Spectral Rigidity (LSR)
- Garland transfer over F2
- Uniform linear filling in X_R(G)
- Hypergraph rank rigidity
- Oblivion Atom (FO^k local asymmetry)

## Downstream (Conditional)
- Chronos / EntropyDepth lower bounds
- FO^k locality collapse
- Spectral Gap Rigidity Wall
- Hypergraph Gadget Rigidity
- Cycle–Local Rigidity

## Non-conditional
None of the above are unconditional without XYSTEM.
