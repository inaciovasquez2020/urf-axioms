# XYSTEM — Rigidity Axiom
**Formal Missing Principle in the Unified Rigidity Framework**

---

## Open Challenge

See **CHALLENGE_XYSTEM.md** — Prove or refute the XYSTEM axiom.

---

## Status

**Conditional (Unproven)**  
**No DOI**  
**No Release Tag**

XYSTEM is a proposed rigidity axiom recorded as a **formal missing principle**.

- No proof is currently known.  
- No refutation is currently known.  
- All results depending on XYSTEM are explicitly labeled **conditional**.  

This repository is intentionally **untagged, unreleased, and non-certified**.

## Role in the Scientific Infrastructure

This repository is a **Tier A module** in the Scientific Infrastructure with the special classification:

> **Tier A — Open Axiom / Frontier Boundary**

It is not a theorem.  
It is not a framework.  
It is not a witness.

It is a **formal boundary object** defining the last unresolved principle in the URF program.

---

## Infrastructure Policy

Because XYSTEM is unproven:

- **No DOI is allowed**  
- **No Zenodo record is allowed**  
- **No frozen release is allowed**  
- **No tag is allowed**

The repository must remain:

- open,
- untagged,
- conditional,
- permanently marked as unresolved.

---

## Reproducibility

This repository contains only:

- the formal statement of XYSTEM,  
- dependency tracking,  
- conditional downstream references.

There are no computational artifacts or verification claims.

## Infrastructure Declaration

This repository is a **Tier A module in the Scientific Infrastructure**.

It contains a canonical **open axiom** of the Unified Rigidity Framework (URF).

- No versioning  
- No certification  
- No DOI  
- No closure
